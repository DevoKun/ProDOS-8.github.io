Overview:
---------

This archive contains two TrueType font files, Apple2Forever.TTF and
Apple2Forever80.TTF. The font is designed to look like the screen font
used by the Apple ][ series of computers, the first computer I ever owned.

The fonts are almost identical except that the "80" font is half the width
of the standard font, and therefore simulates the display output of an
Apple ][ using an 80 Column card.

Both fonts contain the full complement of Apple ][ characters, so even if
your Apple ][ could not display all characters (early models had no lower
case, and only later models had the "Mouse Text" characters) you can now
view them in all their glory.

The only thing you can't prouduce (easily) is flashing characters!


System Requirements
-------------------

Any version of Windows or another operating system that supports
  TrueType fonts.
A tiny amount of hard drive space


Installation and setup:
-----------------------

Simply add the font to the system. In Windows this is done by going
into Control Panel, then into Fonts, selecting Add Font, locating
the files on your hard drive, then clicking OK.


Using the Font
--------------

The characters inside the font are laid out as follows:

  Characters 32 to 127 are the standard ASCII symbols, Upper Case and Lower
  Case letters.

  Characters 128 to 159 are the "Mouse Text" characters that were introduced
  with the Extended 80 Column Card in the Apple //e.

  Characters 160 to 255 are the standard ASCII symbols, Upper Case and Lower
  Case letters again, but this time in Inverse.

(There was no such thing as printing the "Mouse Text" characters in Inverse.)


Typing the regular characters is easy. Getting the "Mouse Text" or Inverse
characters may involve using WIndows' Character Map utility, though
unfortunately it does not appear to sort the characters strictly numerically.

Producing Inverse characters in code is really easy; just at 128.

Use the font at 16 Points inside programs like Paint or Photoshop, disabling
any anti-aliasing or whatever, to get a nice "crisp" output.


Warranty & Bugs
---------------

This font provided "as-is", no warranties expressed or
implied, blah, blah, blah....

If you find a bug or have any problems using the software,
you're free to let me know and I may help you or release
a new version, but am under no obligation to do so. Similarly,
contact me if you would like to see a new feature added, but
I make no promises about doing anything!


Cost & Registration
-------------------

This software is free for use by individuals for home use 
not conducting any business. (That is, if you are an individual
running a business from your home and you use this software
in the running of that business, then you need to register.)

Of course, if you really like the software, I'm not going to
stop you from sending money if you want to! Or maybe sending
a postcard, or just e-mail me a message saying "I use your
software", or whatever.


Businesses, however, must register in order to use this
software legally. The cost varies with the number of users:

1-9:	AU$10
10-99:	AU$50
100+:	AU$100

Note, that is the total cost, not the cost per user. It also
covers all future versions (should there be any.)

Send a cheque in Australian funds to:

	Michael Hurwood
	PO Box 559
	Caringbah NSW 1495

Include your contact details, including e-mail address if
possible, so a receipt can be sent.

If you wish to use this software in your own software package,
or would like access to any of the source files, contact me
with your proposal/requirements.
