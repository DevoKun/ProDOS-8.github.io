    <h1>Announcing ProDOS 2.4 for all Apple II computers</h1>

    <p><img src="ProDOS-2.4-Splash.png"></p>

    <p><em>New version: ProDOS 2.4.2 is available <a href="ProDOS-2.4.2.html">here</a>.</em></p>

    <p>Today, the 30-year anniversary of the Apple IIGS, a new version of the ProDOS operating system has been released.</p>

    <p>ProDOS 2.4 adds new features for all Apple II computers, including the 1977 Integer ROM Apple II.</p>

    <h4>Apple IIGS features of ProDOS 2.4</h4>

    <p><ul>
        <li>Preserves GS/OS dormant state – Now multiple ProDOS games or programs can be booted and still return to GS/OS.</li>

        <li>New ‘Bitsy Boot’ utility allows programs to quit to the 8-bit launcher or return to the 16-bit GS/OS Finder.</li>

        <li>New ‘Bitsy Bye’ program launcher is built into ProDOS 2.4 and allows users to run SYS, S16, BIN, BAS, and TXT files.</li>

        <li>ProDOS 2.4 includes both the 6502 compatibility of ProDOS 1.x and the slot remapping functionality of ProDOS 2.x. Now Apple II programs can use a single version of ProDOS to boot any Apple II and access all storage volumes.</li>

        <li>When run from the Finder, the Solid-Apple key selects whether ProDOS 2.4 will Quit to Bitsy Bye or the Finder.</li>

        <li>ProDOS 2.4 is smaller than ProDOS 2.0.3 and loads faster.</li>

        <li>The ProDOS 2.4 interrupt manager reduces latency and memory-use, resulting in faster, consistent interrupt response.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Apple II features of ProDOS 2.4</h4>

    <p><ul>
        <li>For the first time, the features and improvements of ProDOS 2.x are available on 6502-based Apple ][, Apple ][+, and un-enhanced Apple //e computers.</li>

        <li>All Apple II computers with modern USB storage devices or hard drives can now support up to 14 ProDOS volumes per device.</li>

        <li>Unlike earlier versions of Basic.System which hang on Integer ROM Apple ][ computers. The new Basic.System 1.6 reports that ProDOS Basic requires an Apple ][+ and then quits back to the Bitsy Bye program launcher.</li>

        <li>ProDOS splash screen date of 16-8-16 because Woz.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Bitsy Bye program launcher</h4>

    <p>ProDOS 2.4 includes a new program launcher with many features and improvements over earlier versions of ProDOS:</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li>Runs on all Apple II computers and CPUs: 6502, 65c02 or 65816.</li>

        <li>Allows drives to be selected directly by slot using number keys 1-7.</li>

        <li>Allows files to be selected by typing the first letter of their filename.</li>

        <li>Displays and quickly scrolls through up to 2,733 files per directory.</li>

        <li>Displays and allows selection of all files on a drive, not just System files and directories like previous launchers.</li>

        <li>Displays file types and allows launching Applesoft Basic, Binary, Text exec, and GS/OS S16 files via Basic.System.</li>

        <li>Displays the slot and drive of each device.</li>

        <li>Does not abort on drive errors, but instead lists and allows launching of all readable files.</li>

        <li>The code and data size for Bitsy Bye is less than 1KB, with room to spare (thanks qkumba).</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Bitsy Boot utility</h4>

    <p>Bitsy Boot is a small system program which allows quick and easy booting of Apple II devices in various slots:</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li>Displays all slots which contain active ProDOS devices.</li>

        <li>Allows one-press booting of slots 1-7.</li>

        <li>The most recently-used ProDOS device can be booted using Return or Space.</li>

        <li>If GS/OS was previously booted and is dormant, Open-Apple-Q or Open-Apple-Escape will quit back to GS/OS.</li>

        <li>Bitsy Boot takes only 1 block on disk. Code and data are under 400 bytes.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>Utilities</h4>

    <p>The 140k 5.25″ disk image of ProDOS 2.4 disk also includes these useful utilities:</p>

    <p><ul>

            <li>Requires only 1 block on disk vs 21 blocks for Basic.System</li>
            <li>Loads and runs Binary and Basic programs launched by Bitsy Bye.</li>
            <li>Provides two commands:
            <ul>
                <li>&”Filename” runs a Binary or Basic program.</li>
                <li>& by itself will quit back to ProDOS.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Disk Imaging Programs – ADT Pro and FastDsk allow migrating data from floppy disks to modern computers.</li>

        <li>Disk Utilities – Verify and repair disks. View and edit disk blocks.</li>

        <li>File Utilities – Manage ProDOS and DOS 3.3 files and disks on any Apple II, including Integer ROM Apple ][.</li>

        <li>Shrinkit archive expander – Access Apple II Shrinkit archives commonly found on the internet.</li>
    </ul></p>
