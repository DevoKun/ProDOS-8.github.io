<p>This Technical Note formerly described the DOSCMD vector of BASIC.SYSTEM.</p>

<p>This Note formerly described the DOSCMD vector of BASIC.SYSTEM, which can be 
used to let BASIC.SYSTEM interpret ASCII strings as disk commands in much the 
same way DOS 3.3 did.  The ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual now contains 
this information in Appendix A.</p>
