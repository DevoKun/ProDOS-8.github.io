<h2>Revised by Matt Deatherage (November 1988)
<br>Revised by Pete McDonald (December 1985)</h2>

<p>This Technical Note formerly described conventions for a ProDOS 
application to start and quit.</p>

<blockquote><em>Note:</em> Yes, there are <em>two</em> "revised" by-lines and 
<em>no</em> "written" by-line for this Technical Note.  This is how I found it 
online.  <em>-- AH</em></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Section 5.1.5 of the ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual now documents
the conventions a ProDOS application should follow when starting and
quitting, which were formerly covered in this Note as well as <a href="/docs/technote/14/">ProDOS 8 Technical Note #14</a>, Selector and Dispatcher Conventions.</p>
