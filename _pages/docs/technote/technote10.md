<h2>Revised by Matt Deatherage (November 1988)
<br>Revised by Pete McDonald (November 1985)</h2>

<p>This Technical Note formerly described how to install a clock driver routine 
other than the default.</p>

<blockquote><em>Note:</em> Yes, there are <em>two</em> "revised" by-lines and 
<em>no</em> "written" by-line for this Technical Note.  This is how I found it 
online.  <em>-- AH</em></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Section 6.1.1 of the ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual documents how to 
install a clock driver other than the default ThunderClock(TM) driver or the 
Apple IIGS clock driver into ProDOS 8, which this Note formerly covered.</p>
