We [Apple Computer] want Technical Notes to be distributed as widely as possible, so they are sent to all Partners and Associates at no charge; they are also posted on AppleLink in the Developer Services bulletin board and other electronic sources, including the Apple FTP site (IP 130.43.2.3). You can also order them through Resource Central. As a Resource Central customer, you have access to the tools and documentation necessary to develop Apple II-compatible products.

We [Apple Computer] place no restrictions on copying Technical Notes, with the exception that you cannot resell them, so read, enjoy, and share. We hope Apple II Technical Notes will provide you with lots of valuable information while you are developing Apple II hardware and software. The following pages list all Apple II Technical Notes that have been released.

This Technical Note batch was originally released in May 1992. Since that time, many of the contact addresses have changed and some typographical errors have been fixed. To note these changes, this document now bears the date June 1992. No content of any Notes has changed since May 1992.
