<h2>Revised by Matt Deatherage (November 1988)
<br>Revised by Pete McDonald (December 1985)</h2>

<p>This Technical Note formerly described how to attach an external command to 
BASIC.SYSTEM.</p>

<blockquote><em>Note:</em> Yes, there are <em>two</em> "revised" by-lines and 
<em>no</em> "written" by-line for this Technical Note.  This is how I found it 
online.  <em>-- AH</em></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual, Appendix A now documents the 
information which this Note formerly covered about installing an external 
command into BASIC.SYSTEM to be treated as a normal BASIC.SYSTEM command.</p>
