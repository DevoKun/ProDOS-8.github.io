* Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/theusotsuki">Usotsuki</a>
* Great for compilation disks, this tiny program can be used instead of Basic.System.
* This is NOT a BASIC interpreter but a ProDOS wedge for BASIC
* Requires only 1 block on disk vs 21 blocks for Basic.System
* Loads and runs Binary and Basic programs launched by Bitsy Bye.
* Provides two commands:
  * &"Filename" runs a Binary or Basic program.
  * & by itself will quit back to ProDOS.
