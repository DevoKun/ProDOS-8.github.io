* Bitsy Boot is a small system program which allows quick and easy booting of Apple II devices in various slots.

* Displays all slots which contain active ProDOS devices.
* Allows one-press booting of slots 1-7.
* The most recently-used ProDOS device can be booted using Return or Space.
* If GS/OS was previously booted and is dormant, Open-Apple-Q or Open-Apple-Escape will quit back to GS/OS.
* Bitsy Boot takes only 1 block on disk. Code and data are under 400 bytes.
